##The Network 
In this section lets focus on the underlying technology of World Wide Web. We will explore how systems talk each other and how data is transfer across boundaries. Its good to understand the basics of networking and terminologies. Because it brings you more insight and understanding about the web. 

### Networking Basics

- What is a computer network?
> A computer network is a set of two or more computers connected to each other. The main motivation behind this is the sharing of files and resources across the network. Different types of networks include LAN, WAN, MAN,CAN, etc.

- What is intranet?
> An intranet is group of computer or computer networks linked to each other, whose size is limited to an organization, accessible only to the organization staff.

- What is internet?
> The internet refers to the large network of intranets connected to each other globally, providing various information and communication facilities.

- Explain quickly - What is ISP, IP Address, IPv4 vs IPv6, Domain Name, DNS, Web Server?
> ISP refers to Internet Service Provider, a company that facilitates the internet connection to your offices, families, mobile users.

> IP  Address refers to the unique 12-digit number with which a computer is uniquely identified. It facilitates the communication between two computers in a network.

> IPv4 vs IPv6 - IPv4 and IPv6 are two versions of the Internet Protocol. IP is a set of digital message format and rules for relaying messages between computers across a network. The difference - Address space for IPv4 is 32-bit while for IPv6 it is 64 bit. IPv4 addresses use decimal representation while IPv6 uses hexadecimal.

>Domain Name - Aka web address is what people type into web browsers to find the respective website.

>DNS - DNS is an internet service that translates domain names to ip addresses. Internet is based on ip addresses, but remembering the ip addresses is not practical.

>Web Server - Web Servers are computers operated by hosting companies. They store websites so that people can visit them on the internet.

### Communication Basics

- What is a Communication Protocol?
> Communication Protocol is a set of rules and message formats which are used by computers to send blocks of data among each other.

- What is Internet Protocol Suite?
> The Internet Protocol Suite is a communication protocol stack that is used on the Internet and most computer networks. Other protocol stacks exists, but the IP suite is used as the global standard for computer-to-computer communication.

- Explain each layer of internet protocol suite?
    
    - Link Layer
    >	The first layer of the four-layer TCP/IP. This layer defines how packets are physically sent through the network, i.e., rules that are necessary to connect to the host. 
    Examples of protocols used in this layer - Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI.

    - Internet Layer
		>	The second layer. It facilitates packets to be sent independently over the network. Packets are grouped into IP datagrams which contain source and destination addresses. This layer also takes care of the routing of the IP Datagrams. The order in which the packets are recieved are different from the order in which they are sent.
		Examples of protocols used in this layer - IP, ICMP, ARP, RARP.

    - Transport Layer
    >	The purpose here is to permit the devices on the source and destination to carry out a conversation. This layer adds the header information to the data, and breaks down the data into smaller units to be efficiently handled by the network layer.
    Examples of protocols used - TCP, UDP

    - Application Layer
    >	This layer defines how host programs interface with the Transport Layer. This layer includes higher level protocols such as - HTTP, TELNET, FTP, TFTP, SNMP, SMTP

- What is Transport protocol?
> Examples of the Transport Protocol are TCP and UDP. They are used for sending packets across the network. They are build on top of the Internet Protocol.

- What is Application protocol?
>	This layer facilitates process-to-process communication among computers. These processes include file transfer, web documents, real-time audio/video. This layer defines the type of messages, their syntaxes, and when and how a process sends messages and also responds to messages.

### Introduction to Hyper Text Teansfer Protocol a.k.a HTTP
- What is HTTP?
> It stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. This protocol facilitates in transferring Hypertext from a Web Server to your web browser. It helps you 'get' a resource from the World Wide Web with the help of an URL.

- What is Web Resource?
>	A Web Resource is a collection of software that a web application requires for proper rendering of the web application. They can be images, script files, component libraries.

- What is differnece between URI and URL?
> The Uniform Resource Identifier is used to identify a resource on the web. The Uniform Resource Locator is a subset of the URI. A URL is location bound and defines how the resource is retrieved from the web.

##### HTTP Connection

- What is HTTP Session?
>	It is a series of request-response transactions in order to estabilish a connection between client and server. It consists of three phases -
	1. the client estabilishes a tcp connection
	2. client sends request and waits for answer
	3. server processes request and gives appropriate response

- What is difference between HTTP and HTTP Secure?
>	While HTTP enables client-server connection, HTTPS does this by enforcing encryption in the transport layer. HTTPS is a combination of HTTP and SSL/TSL Secure Socket Layer/ Transport Layer Security. TLS is an authentication and security protocol widely used in browsers and Web Servers.

##### HTTP Request
- What is the structure of a HTTP Request?
>	Made up of the following components -
		1. A request line requesting a resource from the server
		2. Headers
		3. An empty line
		4. A message body - optional

- What are the different HTTP Request Headers?
>	1. Accept - indicates the types of contents the browser will accept
	2. Accept-Language - indicates the language accepted by the browser
	3. Accept-Encoding - indicates the compressed content that can be handled by the browser
	4. Connectin - identifies the kind of connection the browser requests
	5. Host - 
	6. Referrer - indicates if the current request was the result of a link from another page
	7. User-Agent - identifies the version of the browser and the OS on which it runs

- What are the different HTTP request methods available?
>	Primarily - GET and POST. Others include HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, CONNECT.
	GET - requests data from a specified resource
	POST - submits data to be processed to a resource

##### HTTP Response
- What is the structure of a HTTP Response?
>	1. HTTP status code
	2. Headers
	3. An empty line
	4. A message body - optional

- What are the different HTTP Response Headers?
>	1. Cache-Control - indicates if the resource may be cached by the browser
	2. Content-Length - length of the resource
	3. Content-Type - format
	4. Date - current date and time of the web server
	5. Expires - when the content need to be considered out of date
	6. Pragma - to prevent caches from storing content
	7. Server - indicates the web server

- What are the different HTTP response status code?
>	1xx - Informational
	2xx - Success
	3xx - Redirection
	4xx - Client Error
	5xx - Server Error

- What is HTTP Response Body?
> same as structure of a http response

	```

2. Prepare a Request Header for the following requirement. — “I need to get a html page called `secret.html` from webmaster server. But to get the right html page you need to send a text message saying `hello` with the request. Don't forget that our client application is only able to parse html content, so specify in the header otherwise server will send response with random content type.”
>	GET /secret.html http/1.0
	
	hello

3. Prepare a Response Header for a succesfull request for `secret.html`

4. Prepare a Response Header for a 404 request
